## 📦 Installation
Make sure you have Rust installed. You can install it using [Rustup](https://rustup.rs/):

### 𓀃 The Actual Installation

Make sure you have Rust installed. You can install it using Rustup:
```sh
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```
Then, clone this repository and build the project:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/JakubStachh/Rust-Projects.git
```
```sh
cd Rust-Projects
```
```sh
cargo build --release
```
## 🚀 Usage

Run the project with:
```sh
cargo run --release
```
To run a specific program (e.g., Fibonacci Sequence):
```sh
cargo run --bin fibonacci
```
To run all tests:
```sh
cargo test 
```
## 🐜 Examples

📌 Fibonacci Sequence
```sh
$ cargo run --bin fibonacci
Enter the number: 10
Fibonacci(10) = 55
```
