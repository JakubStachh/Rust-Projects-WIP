# 📌 Character Frequency Counter in Rust

## 🚀 Description
This Rust program counts how many times each character appears in a given string using a **HashMap**.

## 🔍 How It Works
**The function count_characters(s: &str) -> HashMap<char, i32>:**

Iterates over each character in the string.

Uses a HashMap to store character frequencies.

Increments the count for each character.

**The main function:**

Defines a sample string ("hello world").

Calls count_characters to process the string.

Prints the frequency of each character.
